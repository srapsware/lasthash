				<p> All Web Design / Web Development / Mobile Application Development / Sofware Developemnt / Search Engine Optimization / Digital Marketing/Hosting Services/ Maintenance of a website are carried out and accepted after total analysis and creation of a complete scope document, in order to ensure that our teams have full understanding of the work needed to be done, eliminating possibilities of any project cancellation / reversal / dispute. </p>
				<p> Since Lasthash and the client understand that there is work involved to achieve every milestone of the project and completion of every module, a refund would not be possible for the work once assigned to us. </p>

				<p> If we receive a chargeback or payment dispute (i.e. PayPal Dispute) from a credit card company or bank, your service and/or project will be suspended without notice. A $50 chargeback fee (issued to recover fees passed on to us by the credit company), plus any outstanding balances accrued as a result of the chargeback(s) must be paid in full before service is restored, files delivered, or any further work is done. Instead of issuing a chargeback, contact us to address any billing issues. Requesting a chargeback or opening a PayPal dispute for a valid charge from us is fraud, and is never an appropriate or legal means of obtaining a refund. Please read and make sure you fully understand our refund policy prior to making a payment. </p>

We interact with our clients and do our best to solve all their queries and start work after their approval, therefore, there is no provision for any kind of refund. We clearly mentioned that the paid amount is non-refundable in any circumstance. </p>
